<p>monome is <a href="http://nnnnnnnn.co">brian crabtree</a> and <a href="http://kellicain.com">kelli cain</a>. we met in art school where our initial collaborations included electro-mechanical installations, films, and music. now we live and work in the mountains of upstate new york where we also tend apple orchards, shiitake stacks, and forest paths.</p>

<p>monome is operated on a human scale. we use local suppliers and manufacturers with whom we've built long-term, trusting relationships. we believe in beautiful design and quality craftsmanship. staying small affords us the flexibility to pursue interesting new directions, not simply commodify established trends.</p>

<p>monome is supported by a global community of curious, helpful, and creative people.</p>

<p>we began in 2005. we continue.</p>
