<p><em>b: what is your fondest non-functional object? something you simply behold.</em></p>
<p>k: everything has a function-- if even to simply provide wonder or happiness. i have a collection of feathers. and a few notes and letters i behold this way.</p>
<p><em>b: how have your thoughts on manufacturing changed since undertaking this project?</em></p>
<p>k: my thoughts on manufacturing really have not changed much. i still believe strong domestic connections are best and seeing people face to face even better. we've had production relationships from the beginning that have proven this theory. the only disappointments here and there are the matter of reject parts, time delays, and waste-- it's part of the work aspect, the business side that is tedious.</p>
<p><em>b: describe your work outfit.</em></p>
<p>k: work outfit varies depending on the work. right now i'm in layers, an apron, and covered mostly in porcelain slip. I think I spend the majority of my day covered in some sort of filth be it animal, mineral or vegetable.</p>
<p><em>b: estimate how many LEDs you've soldered.</em></p>
<p>k: 30,000</p>
<p><em>b: two books which have deeply influenced your worldview.</em></p>
<p>k: worldviews eh. the life and death of the great american city (jane jacobs) extraordinary groups (schaefer and zellner).</p>
<p><em>b: first time seeing a grid performance. did anything break mid-set?</em></p>
<p>k: ha. nothing broke but it was a 10 minute set i think and honestly maybe something broke and i didn't notice... i was distracted (ahem). but i've seen my fair share of repairs on stage or set ups crashing.</p>
<p><em>b: a place that no longer exists, that you'd like to visit, where?</em></p>
<p>k: a place that no longer exists: such a good question. there are so many really. but to name a few... the original pennsylvania station, kowloon walled city, persepolis in the time of xerxes.</p>
<p><em>b: what part of music making has been most intriguing to you recently?</em></p>
<p>k: recording music is relatively new to me, i started last year actually. i think, as a result of my background, the most important focus has been capturing a tone or an atmosphere, wanting the recording to feel very present, tangible almost and just as imperfect as my process. maybe something that people can picture. like the four corners and the close ups and the creaking floors. and maybe something that people can sense like the difficulty i have with singing and rhythm and my hesitation to engage in repetition almost to a point of chaos. those elements are all very real for me and i want to find ways to share that because it's truth. i like truth.</p>
<p><em>b: your favorite natural material. and synthetic material?</em></p>
<p>k: my favorite natural material. wool coat. linen dress. silk lining. cotton sheets. wooden bench. kitty cat. cotton paper. porcelain cup. leaves and old apples underfoot. water surrounding. i'm a tactile person i think. i could go on and on. as far as synthetics- plastic in the historical sense. like in terms of its evolution not so much as a material I'd like to use in design. bakelite for example. one of the most fascinating books i've read was called <em>plastic</em> by stephen fenichell. it's strange how often i think about the dilemma of plastic. hard to imagine how invention can so drastically change the cultural and economic landscape of an entire populace. it's a reminder that in spite of how insignificant we individually seem, our decisions can have great impact. weights of responsibility and all that...</p>
<p><em>b: with which non-human species do you most closely identify?</em></p>
<p>k: hawk. cat. cathawk.</p>
<p><em>b: do you remember the asphodel party, where monome was physically introduced? give me a three word generalization, and then a short elaboration.</em></p>
<p>k: awkward introductions abound.</p>
<p>the asphodel party felt like the beginning of something i could neither fully understand or appreciate quite yet. it was a curious thing-- to finally see the people who were interested in what you were doing and who would potentially have the power to change your life-- if even only through monetary support. in my memory we were all wearing black. the surround sound system was intense and made me wish i was in a band. ezra buchla performed with a 200e next to a 40h and it gave me chills to see the two hanging out, inferiority complex aside.</p>
<p><em>b: sun or moon?</em></p>
<p>k: moon.</p>
<p><em>b: what have you given to the internet recently?</em></p>
<p>k: i'm not sure i give the internet much. music here and there and the occasional photograph. do i owe it more? maybe. it's given me some pretty good cat videos lately.</p>
<p><em>b: your proudest farm moment?</em></p>
<p>k: proudest farm moment. there are so many. capturing two bee swarms. and i think the day we figured out we could take the goats on long walks and they'd follow.</p>
<p><em>b: which movement in film most inspires you?</em></p>
<p>k: i should preface this answer with i went to film school and i'm going to give a typical film school answer: the french new wave has had a huge impact on how i view story telling- the individual importance placed on both language and visuals changed the way i felt about the experience of seeing a film. words are as important as scenes are as important as silence. the eyes are that through which i sense the world. language is how I see it. silence is how i feel it. or some such nonsense...</p>
<p><em>b: what do you think about while brushing your teeth?</em></p>
<p>k: i think about what the other hand is doing.</p>
<p><em>b: have you ever unexpectedly screamed with excitement? like those weird television spots where someone wins the lottery and the big check and everything. what happened?</em></p>
<p>k: yes. i love unexpectedly screaming with excitement. i wish the impulse happened more often. once. we had a hen who had a chick who then abandoned it. we chose another hen as a foster mom and hoped she'd take the role seriously. i went in the barn to check on the two and couldn't find the chick anywhere. it's a heart sinking feeling what you know nature is capable of (it was possible that the hen would have eaten the chick). lo. behold. the hen, who was up and walking around opened her wing and let the little well warmed chick bounce to the floor. it was a bold display. a showing off even and a magical feat maybe. i lost it. seriously five octaves higher and maybe even a tear or two.</p>
<p>i'd be curious if you recall me having a moment like this in your presence.</p>

<p><em>k: what both fascinates and terrifies you in equal measure?</em></p>
<p>b: underground rivers. the part of the cavern where you have to swim underwater for an undetermined amount of time, but you know that wherever you emerge will be amazing and incredible, if nothing else because you survived the journey. this is how life is, right?</p>
<p><em>k: when you're wishing you are somewhere else where is the else you wish?</em></p>
<p>b: with family and friends. or the sea or the desert. or places i haven't seen, somewhere to shake up my mind and spirit. i'm constantly impressed by how much i do not know.</p>
<p><em>k: mountain top or valley? why?</em></p>
<p>b: both but in different moments. the valley takes care of us. sustenance, water, shelter. the mountain top allows us to see far, stretching imagination, allowing introspection. but in general i'm very fond of water. it's pretty important historically. ha.</p>
<p><em>k: why musical notation?</em></p>
<p>b: as someone who is at times primarily interested in harmony and progression, notation represents a raw form that can be reinterpreted. it's much different from working with audio stems, where cutting and processing create variation. oftentimes a musical idea for me is best recorded with a few scribbles. whether it was this synth or that instrument is less important.</p>
<p><em>k: what pop star surprises you in a positive way and are you humming it right now?</em></p>
<p>b: contemporarily i'm not sure honestly, but i'm becoming less ashamed about my hopeless addiction to depeche mode.</p>
<p><em>k: if you could have a look see at the inside of anything- anything in the world, what would it be? can be more than one thing.</em></p>
<p>b: right now i'd like to know if the goats are pregnant, but that's not terribly profound. i'd be curious to see a log or transcript of my inner dialog over the course of a day. i think it'd be incredibly humbling, probably scary. it couldn't be a conscious process, this recording. a sort of spying on yourself. or maybe that's too weird.</p>
<p><em>k: what word do you find pretty to look at?</em></p>
<p>b: wool. pesk. be.</p>
<p><em>k: do you have a memorable pre-monome performance?</em></p>
<p>b: in high school i won some sort of songwriting contest that forced me into a live performance. since the music was completely sequenced on some 90's korg synth, all i could really do was hit play on the sequencer and sit there on stage, at times pretending to play some little flourish, but mostly just sat there looking remarkably awkward, as if this situation hadn't occurred to me until that exact moment.</p>
<p><em>k: if you have lunch with an expert in any field what field?</em></p>
<p>b: geology. and by lunch i mean we hike for weeks around various parts of california. i find the geologic time scale to be spiritually soothing. it's hard to be alarmed about the present when considering how incredibly long this whole program has been running.</p>
<p><em>k: any surprising luxuries you'd like to speak on?</em></p>
<p>b: wood stove. must be close to the warm thing.</p>
<p><em>k: if you had the time and patience what genre of film would you most likely explore in depth?</em></p>
<p>b: i wouldn't want to spoil my incredible cultural ignorance in this department.</p>
<p><em>k: the last book of fiction you got swept up in?</em></p>
<p>b: most recently master and margarita by bulgakov. who'd have thought i'd be so excited by historical-biblical fiction? currently on infinite jest by dfw.</p>
<p><em>k: what's one of the more difficult experiences you've had creatively?</em></p>
<p>b: setting boundaries and defining identity. it's incredible that our identities are self-defined yet in so many cases feel out of our control. monome has become part of our lives in such a way that it has been heavily defining, which is complicated to navigate at times.</p>
<p><em>k: what, of monome, if any, in the business sense, has been surprisingly easier than you expected?</em></p>
<p>b: i don't feel like i had to do so much convincing that the decoupled grid was a good idea, that it presented great opportunity. when i made the first prototypes there was nothing like it going on-- we thought there would maybe be only a handful of people interested.</p>
<p><em>k: now that you've been doing it for six years, how have you felt your skill set shift?</em></p>
<p>b: it's been a massive oscillation. i studied electrical engineering and computer science initially in undergrad but became bored and shifted to a new media art program. in graduate school i studied composition while building a grid prototype with insufficient engineering skills. but played shows constantly. since then i've been making less music but am often confounded by the engineering time i've put in. i think it's time to go back towards music.</p>
<p>in general it's been an opportunity to explore the workings of industry and economics. when giving talks we tend to discuss these issues far more than the history of computer music interface or art, etc.</p>
<p><em>k: how do you view age?</em></p>
<p>b: it seems inverted. you grow older and only discover more unanswered questions.</p>
<p><em>k: bed. in five words.</em></p>
<p>b: i like you too much.</p>
