<p><img src="image/grid.jpg" alt="monome grid" /></p>
<p>an open, tactile instrument that allows the user to imagine and define its function.</p>
<p>the monome <i>grid</i> by default does nothing. connected to a computer or module, interaction is determined by the chosen application: sequencer, sample cutter, tone map, polyrhythm machine. weâ€™ve put together studies to help you create your own.</p>

<p>changes. travels. is open to possibilities.</p> 
<p><i>norns</i> is many sound instruments. it connects to grids, MIDI and other objects. norns lets you define its behavior with scripts and DSP. we've created extensive studies to help actualize new instruments yet to be imagined. </p>

<p>speaks and listens and remembers bits of text. a scriptable usb-cv-ii machine.</p>
<p><i>crow</i> connects to norns and computers running max, max for live, and other serial-enabled applications. we've created various norns scripts and max for live devices which require no programming, and we've also created tutorials and studies to get you started quickly programming your own ideas into this tiny, powerful module. </p>

<p>algorithmic ecosystem for modular synths.</p>
<p><i>teletype</i> is a dynamic, musical event triggering platform. edit scripts with a USB keyboard which plugs into the front panel. syntax is simple and easy to learn with the provided tutorials, video, and reference pages. teletype runs without the keyboard attached: you might treat editing as precomposition, or leave the keyboard plugged in for live coding. </p>

<hr/>
<p>we're enduring the semiconductor shortage alongside basically all small manufacturers. this is the reason that we do not have known restock dates for many of our devices. we'll update this site as we learn more. i wrote a <a href="https://llllllll.co/t/scarcity-and-precarity-in-small-manufacturing/55896">longer essay</a> which may be of further interest.</p>
<p>we've also had to increase pricing to accommodate rising costs of components, contract manufacturing, and transportation. in addition to delays we're also encountering quality issues, which contribute a substantial amount of labor to ensure everything is in working order. we'll adjust pricing as the situation changes.</p>

<p>monome is <a href="https://nnnnnnnn.co">brian crabtree</a> and <a href="http://kellicain.com">kelli cain</a>. we met in art school where our initial collaborations included electro-mechanical installations, films, and music. now we live and work in the mountains of upstate new york where we also tend apple orchards, shiitake stacks, and forest paths.</p>
<p>monome is operated on a human scale. we use local suppliers and manufacturers, assemble and test in house, and only sell direct. like our designs, our organization is focussed on adaptability and the long-term. staying small affords us the flexibility to pursue interesting new directions, not simply commodify established trends.</p>
<p>monome is supported by a global community of curious, helpful, and creative people. <a href="https://dndrks.bandcamp.com">dan derks</a> is on the team. all based at <a href="https://luckdragon.space">luck dragon</a>.</p>
<p>we began in 2005. we continue.</p>
