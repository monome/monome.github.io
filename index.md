[![](/image/both.jpg)](/image/high/both.jpg)
an open, tactile instrument that allows the user to imagine and define its function.

the monome _grid_ by default does nothing. connected to a computer or module, interaction is determined by the chosen application: sequencer, sample cutter, tone map, polyrhythm machine. weâ€™ve put together studies to help you create your own.

![barn](/image/barn.jpg)

monome is [brian crabtree](https://nnnnnnnn.co) and [kelli cain](http://kellicain.com). we met in art school where our initial collaborations included electro-mechanical installations, films, and music. now we live and work in the mountains of upstate new york where we also tend apple orchards, shiitake stacks, and forest paths.</p>

monome is operated on a human scale. we use local suppliers and manufacturers, assemble and test in house, and only sell direct. like our designs, our organization is focussed on adaptability and the long-term. staying small affords us the flexibility to pursue interesting new directions, not simply commodify established trends.

monome is supported by a global community of curious, helpful, and creative people. [dani derks](https://dndrks.com) is on the team. all based at [luck dragon](https://luckdragon.space).

we began in 2005. we continue.
