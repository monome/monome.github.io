<p>B-Stock</p>
<p>Occasionally we make &quot;b-stock&quot; available. This term may mean different things so here we will clarify:</p>
<ul>
<li>All devices are new. Not used, not returns.</li>
<li>All devices are 100% functioning. The circuitry is the identical.</li>
</ul>
<p>For monome, b-stock simply means minor cosmetic imperfections in the metal finishing such as a hairline scratch, visual interruption in the texture, or watermarking in the anodization. B-stock will not have machining errors or dents from mishandling.</p>
<p>We go to great lengths to inspect and frequently re-buff each metal component. We grade components into three classes: A (basically perfect), B-stock, and reworks (which are sent back to be refinished). B-stock is what we can't call absolutely perfect but would be a complete waste of energy (and money) to ship back, strip the finish, rebuff, re-anodize, and ship back for be reinspected.</p>
<p>So instead we offer b-stock at a discount.</p>
<p>Frequently after grading a component as b-stock we have a difficult time identifying the visual issue. Typically you will not notice the flaw of a b-stock unit unless you are very deliberately searching for it.</p>
<p>We cannot document the flaw of each b-stock unit ahead of purchase. Here are a couple of examples, however. Note that these photos were taken to maximize the visibility of the flaw: at other angles of light reflection they are completely invisible. Capturing the flaw was a comic exercise in trying to reveal an issue (which is a different story when trying to convey problems to our machine shop).</p>

<p>Above: discoloration above the first arc knob.</p>
<p><a href="/image/high/bstock2.jpg"><img src="/image/bstock2.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>
<p>Above: hairline scratch on the grid, with discolorations in the upper corner.</p>
<p><img src="/image/refinishing.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>This is our typical refinishing setup. Isopropyl alcohol will clean the surface, and then an ultra-fine scotch-brite pad will remove surface scuffs and even the texture. If you have an old machine that needs a solid rework, we recommend this technique.</p>
<hr />
<br/>
B-stock devices carry the same warranty. We cannot exchange a b-stock for a different b-stock if the imperfections are undesirable, but we will do a return. If you come in person you're welcome to sort through the b-stock units.
