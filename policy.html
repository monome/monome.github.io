<p>monome is a very tiny organization (three people), operating at human scale. we take great care to ensure all items sent from our NY workshop are in optimal working condition by partnering with local circuit board manufacturers, assembling each unit by hand, and packing them with care.</p>
<p>if you receive an item which is not up to performance standard, please let us know as soon as you can by emailing <code>help@monome.org</code>. we will work with you to swap the item or arrange a return.</p>
<p>every item purchased from monome is backed by a two year warranty to fully cover manufacturing failure (shipping costs are not covered). if any item fails during regular use within two years of purchase, please let us know as soon as it happens by emailing <code>help@monome.org</code>. be sure to include your order number, as well as a description of the trouble.</p>
<p>if you are not the original owner or if the item is older than two years, we will still do everything we can to keep our devices out of landfills. we offer incredibly reasonable repairs through our workshop (typically $50-$75 USD + shipping) and guidance for any applicable at-home service. just reach out to us by emailing <code>help@monome.org</code> with a description of the issue, including any photos or videos which would help us precisely identify the best course of action.</p>
