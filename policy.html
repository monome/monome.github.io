<p>Taxes</p>
<p>For international orders, taxes and duty will be collected at time of sale. No additional payment or negotiation should be necessary upon arrival of the package.</p>
<p>We cannot mark packages as undervalued.</p>
<hr />
<p>Cancellations</p>
<p>Orders which have not yet shipped may be canceled any time before shipment for a full refund minus a 5% processing fee. This is due to payment processors not refunding fees. Refunds must be sent to the original form of payment.</p>
<hr />
<p>Returns</p>
<ol>
<li>Within 7 days of delivery, email help@monome.org to arrange a return.</li>
<li>Re-pack item(s) in their original packaging, as you received them. If any item had its own box, please repack it in a larger package – do not repurpose the item’s retail box as a sole shipping package.</li>
<li>Once we receive the return, any item(s) in new/unused condition will receive a full refund minus shipping costs, duty/taxes (if international), and a 5% processing fee. Any used item(s) will be subject to a restocking fee as outlined below (excluding any shipping costs).</li>
</ol>
<p>Restocking</p>
<ul>
<li>Unopened/unused: item is returned exactly as received. No fee.</li>
<li>Used, like-new: item is returned with all original packaging and accessories, item has no visible wear. 10% fee.</li>
<li>Used: item is returned without original packaging or accessories, item has visible wear, 20+% determined after appraisal fee.</li>

</ul>

<p>Warranty</p>
<p>monome is a very tiny organization. We operate at a human scale. We take great care to ensure all items sent from our NY workshop are in optimal working condition by working closely with manufacturers, assembling and testing in house by hand, and packing with care.</p>
<p>If you receive an item which is not up to performance standard, please let us know as soon as you can by emailing help@monome.org; we will work with you to swap the item or arrange a return.</p>
<p>Every item purchased from monome is backed by a two year warranty to fully cover manufacturing failure (shipping costs are not covered). If any item fails during regular use within two years of purchase by the original owner, please let us know as soon as it happens by emailing help@monome.org. Be sure to include your order number, as well as a description of the trouble.</p>
<p>If you are not the original owner or if the item is older than two years, we will still do everything we can to keep our devices out of landfills. We offer reasonable repairs through our workshop (typically $50-$75 USD plus shipping) and guidance for any applicable at-home service. Reach out to us by emailing help@monome.org with a description of the issue, including any photos which would help us precisely identify the best course of action.</p>
