<p>04/04/24 - many have asked about an upgrade option for existing norns with encoders, to use the infinite potentiometers featured on the new edition. we're testing an idea for this and can share results in a couple weeks.</p>
<p>we've begun shipping norns, according to order times. you'll get a tracking number when yours ships. this first batch is somewhat small as one part was delayed, so we expect to be a week or two behind initial estimates. we'll post an update here soon.</p>
