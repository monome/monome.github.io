<p>11/23/25 - it's time, again, to talk about food. over the last decade our friends at star route farm have continued growing produce and caring for the land. they've also been ambitiously imagining new futures by organizing a huge number of regional growers into a network of mutual aid distribution. this requires funding, logistics, and vision. the amount of food they deliver to underserved communities using this model is simply phenomenal. this future is possible.</p>
