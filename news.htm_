<p><a href="https://www.audiodamage.com/collections/software/products/ad059-circa">circa</a> by audio damage is a looping-layering plugin akin to mlr (and what continued to evolve, such as <a href="https://cdm.link/mlre-is-an-expanded-version-of-the-classic-monomer-mlr-focused-on-performance/">mlre</a>. it's perhaps the first commercial plugin to directly support monome grids and arc. also, audio damage is one of the few audio companies offering linux support--- and circa is a good candidate for turning some old laptop into a standalone instrument.</p>
