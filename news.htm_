<p>06/06/25 - unpredictable geopolitics with regard to tariffs have created various levels of delay and price increase so it makes sense not to have surprises when ordering internationally. now all international orders will include duty and taxes to be prepaid. these will be listed as line items, and the package should arrive to you quickly and without added complexity and surprise costs. as before, there's basically no way for us to undervalue packages. as before, if we were to use international retailers these costs would be lumped into the cost passed onto you. but prepaying duty means you lock in a price, whereas the daily policy rollercoaster might leave packages in transit a less certain landing. we'll see how this works out for now and reassess if need be.</p>
<p>mid-summer is intentionally vague as we build more machines and await component shipments, but i think arc may be ready early july and norns in late july.</p>
<p>before then we'll have something to share on the <a href="https://monome.org/docs/iii/">iii</a> front.</p>
