<p>11/23/24 - we're celebrating the season's first snow storm with candles, waiting for the power to return.</p>
<p>we've added some b-stock units to the site, each in limited supply. it's been said that our b-stock is almost impossible to identify as having imperfections. what that really means is that we've been doing this a really long time and can't unsee some things.</p>
<p>also, if you're near delhi ny and want to pick up anything in person, we love <em>not</em> giving money to credit card companies and will pass along the discount and more. and there are new things to be seen which don't have public announcements yet ready-- but we sometimes pull off a half decent improvised show and tell in person.</p>
