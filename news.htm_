<p>12/12/23 - this year the supply chain continued to impact our ability to produce norns, but we did manage to secure parts recently and expect to have a new edition in february. we're engineering a lot of production optimization to offset constantly rising manufacturing costs. one huge benefit of this is a more reliable machine.</p>
<p>we still have grids stocked and ready to ship, though be advised we're entering shipping mayhem season.</p>
