B-Stock

Occasionally we make "b-stock" available. For monome, “b-stock” simply means minor cosmetic imperfections in the metal finishing such as a hairline scratch, visual interruption in the texture, or watermarking in the anodization. To note, b-stock devices are:

- Brand new. Not used, not returns.
- 100% functioning, new circuitry.
- Free from machining errors or dents from mishandling.
- Warrantied for two years, same as all monome devices.

We go to great lengths to inspect and frequently re-buff each metal component. If a metal component is graded as b-stock, it means we can't call it absolutely perfect, but we cannot justify the energy (and money) to ship it back to the machine shop to strip the finish, rebuff, re-anodize, and ship back to us for re-inspection.

So instead we offer b-stock at a discount. Note that we cannot exchange one b-stock unit for another if the imperfections are undesirable, but we can process a return, subject to our [standard policies](/policy.html). If you visit our workshop in person, you're welcome to sort through the b-stock units.

Typically, you will not notice the flaw of a b-stock unit unless you are very deliberately searching for it. Even we frequently have a difficult time re-identifying the visual issue after its initial classification.

Though we cannot document the flaw of each b-stock unit ahead of purchase, here are a couple of examples. Note that these photos were taken to maximize the visibility of the flaw: at other angles of light reflection they are completely invisible.

This is our typical refinishing setup. Isopropyl alcohol will clean the surface, and then an ultra-fine scotch-brite pad will remove surface scuffs and even the texture. If you have an old machine that needs a solid rework, we recommend this technique.
