<p>so we made a new thing<br />
but really an old thing<br />
from over a decade ago<br />
and so there was this impulse that we had to<br />
somehow make the new thing actually new<br />
with a fancy new application or something<br />
but i guess we decided not to do that<br />
this light pattern is an experiment we made a few months ago<br />
with a demoscene-era plasma technique<br />
the important stuff all happens in one line of code<br />
which we wanted to mention simply to spread the concept of<br />
permacomputing and also<br />
despite the grid fundamentally being interactive<br />
sometimes a visual or sound can powerfully stand on its own<br />
like when nine inch nails had this same new thing on stage<br />
just visualizing and hell they are still cooler than us<br />
but really the point is<br />
the grid hasn't meaningfully changed for two decades<br />
still doing nothing yet<br />
containing endless horizons to explore new instrument design<br />
a vehicle for new skills and<br />
perhaps making new friends<br />
but we guess everyone knows that by now<br />
so it's new and it's the same<br />
and that's mostly why there's not really a new killer app<br />
lesser reasons include<br />
us opening an art store and<br />
still tending a farm and finding time to make music<br />
such as this forthcoming softbits you're hearing now<br />
but we are glad to be building these again<br />
and look forward to seeing what comes next</p>

an open, tactile instrument that allows the user to imagine and define its function.</p>
<p>the monome <em>grid</em> by default does nothing. connected to a computer or module, interaction is determined by the chosen application: sequencer, sample cutter, tone map, polyrhythm machine. we’ve put together studies to help you create your own.</p>

<p><em>norns</em> is many sound instruments. it connects to grids, MIDI and other objects. norns lets you define its behavior with scripts and DSP. we've created extensive studies to help actualize new instruments yet to be imagined.</p>

<p>speaks and listens and remembers bits of text. a scriptable usb-cv-ii machine.</p>
<p><em>crow</em> connects to norns and computers running max, max for live, and other serial-enabled applications. we've created various norns scripts and max for live devices which require no programming, and we've also created tutorials and studies to get you started quickly programming your own ideas into this tiny, powerful module.</p>

<p>monome is <a href="https://nnnnnnnn.co">brian crabtree</a> and <a href="http://kellicain.com">kelli cain</a>. we met in art school where our initial collaborations included electro-mechanical installations, films, and music. now we live and work in the mountains of upstate new york where we also tend apple orchards, shiitake stacks, and forest paths.</p></p>
<p>monome is operated on a human scale. we use local suppliers and manufacturers, assemble and test in house, and only sell direct. like our designs, our organization is focussed on adaptability and the long-term. staying small affords us the flexibility to pursue interesting new directions, not simply commodify established trends.</p>
<p>monome is supported by a global community of curious, helpful, and creative people. <a href="https://dndrks.com">dan derks</a> is on the team. all based at <a href="https://luckdragon.space">luck dragon</a>.</p>
<p>we began in 2005. we continue.</p>
