an open, tactile instrument that allows the user to imagine and define its function.</p>
<p>the monome <em>grid</em> by default does nothing. connected to a computer or module, interaction is determined by the chosen application: sequencer, sample cutter, tone map, polyrhythm machine. we’ve put together studies to help you create your own.</p>

<p><em>crow</em> connects to norns and computers running max, max for live, and other serial-enabled applications. we've created various norns scripts and max for live devices which require no programming, and we've also created tutorials and studies to get you started quickly programming your own ideas into this tiny, powerful module.</p>

<p>monome is <a href="https://nnnnnnnn.co">brian crabtree</a> and <a href="http://kellicain.com">kelli cain</a>. we met in art school where our initial collaborations included electro-mechanical installations, films, and music. now we live and work in the mountains of upstate new york where we also tend apple orchards, shiitake stacks, and forest paths.</p></p>
<p>monome is operated on a human scale. we use local suppliers and manufacturers, assemble and test in house, and only sell direct. like our designs, our organization is focussed on adaptability and the long-term. staying small affords us the flexibility to pursue interesting new directions, not simply commodify established trends.</p>
<p>monome is supported by a global community of curious, helpful, and creative people. <a href="https://dndrks.com">dan derks</a> is on the team. all based at <a href="https://luckdragon.space">luck dragon</a>.</p>
<p>we began in 2005. we continue.</p>
