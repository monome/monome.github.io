Taxes

BE AWARE: International orders are subject to import taxes and duty upon arrival, which will be paid by the receiver. This is typically around 20% of the retail cost. The carrier will contact you when the item arrives in customs to arrange payment. If this payment is refused and the package is returned, we will be forced to pay this duty and return shipping, which will be deducted from your refund.

Cancellations

Orders which have not yet shipped may be canceled any time before shipment for a full refund minus a 5% processing fee. This is due to payment processors not refunding fees.Refunds must be sent to the original form of payment.

Warranty

monome is a very tiny organization, just three people. We operate at a human scale. We take great care to ensure all items sent from our NY workshop are in optimal working condition by partnering with local circuit board manufacturers, assembling each unit by hand, and packing them with care.

If you receive an item which is not up to performance standard, please let us know as soon as you can by emailing help@monome.org; we will work with you to swap the item or arrange a return.

Every item purchased from monome is backed by a two year warranty to fully cover manufacturing failure (shipping costs are not covered). If any item fails during regular use within two years of purchase by the original owner, please let us know as soon as it happens by emailing help@monome.org. Be sure to include your order number, as well as a description of the trouble.

If you are not the original owner or if the item is older than two years, we will still do everything we can to keep our devices out of landfills. We offer incredibly reasonable repairs through our workshop (typically $50-$75 USD plus shipping) and guidance for any applicable at-home service. Reach out to us by emailing help@monome.org with a description of the issue, including any photos or videos which would help us precisely identify the best course of action.
