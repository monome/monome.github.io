crow has departed. trent and i agreed that it was time to discontinue as we both have new projects we're deep into and every time crow stock runs out we say we're going to do the successor project. and maybe we actually will, once we emerge from the fog.

but this was also a moment to rediscover what we did, where crow went. it started as a CV extension for norns. but as everything unfolded it went much, much further. the original release video above reminded me.

we look forward to seeing crow's genetics reappear and continue to evolve. thank you for coming on the journey with us.
