tomorrow at 1pm EDT orders will open for a new batch of norns. we're back to the original encoders, which have a fast action. the knobs sit just a bit higher. they feel great. otherwise everything is the same as before.

at the same time we're making available a lot of b-stock devices. b-stock means something different for various companies, so we [wrote up the specifics](/bstock.html) and included some photos. in short: they are near perfect, and they are 10% off.

keep in mind that if you're international and haven't ordered in awhile, we switched over to collecting all import tax and duty ahead of time. on delivery you won't have to deal with any of that complication.

lastly, we're running very low on crow. when we run out we may not be reordering. or if we do, it'd be some time off. or maybe trent and i will follow through on a new design. but that would be even further off. time flies and crows fly too.
