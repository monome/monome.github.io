08/25/23 - it's almost september and many of you noticed that we're expecting to have availability in september. we've just set the date: friday, september 15. at 1pm EDT the order links will be live. shipping will begin the following week.

you may have also noticed, below this message next to "old news" is a link to rss. [rss (wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS) isn't talked about enough these days. you can easily get an rss reader for your phone or computer (or use a web service, but we have a difficult time recommending them). add a new feed: monome.org/rss.xml --- and you will receive updates like this.

this was the decentralized utopia we were promised by computers. maybe we can find it again.

we'll still send out the newsletter, but as email becomes increasingly broken and commodified we'd like to help foster other ways of connecting.
