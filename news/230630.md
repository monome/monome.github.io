so we made a new thing  
but really an old thing  
from over a decade ago  
and so there was this impulse that we had to  
somehow make the new thing actually new  
with a fancy new application or something  
but i guess we decided not to do that  
this light pattern is an experiment we made a few months ago  
with a demoscene-era plasma technique  
the important stuff all happens in one line of code  
which we wanted to mention simply to spread the concept of  
permacomputing and also  
despite the grid fundamentally being interactive  
sometimes a visual or sound can powerfully stand on its own  
like when nine inch nails had this same new thing on stage  
just visualizing and hell they are still cooler than us  
but really the point is  
the grid hasn't meaningfully changed for two decades  
still doing nothing yet  
containing endless horizons to explore new instrument design  
a vehicle for new skills and  
perhaps making new friends  
but we guess everyone knows that by now  
so it's new and it's the same  
and that's mostly why there's not really a new killer app  
lesser reasons include  
us opening an art store and  
still tending a farm and finding time to make music  
such as this forthcoming softbits you're hearing now  
but we are glad to be building these again  
and look forward to seeing what comes next
