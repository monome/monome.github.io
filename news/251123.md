11/23/25 - it's time, again, to talk about food. over the last decade our friends at star route farm have continued growing produce and caring for the land. they've also been ambitiously imagining new futures by organizing a huge number of regional growers into a network of mutual aid distribution. this requires funding, logistics, and vision. the amount of food they deliver to under-resourced communities using this model is simply phenomenal. this future is possible.

again we're donating to support their mission. read more about the project: [catskills agrarian alliance](https://www.catskillsagrarianalliance.org)

use code CAA for 10% off anything here, until dec 1.
