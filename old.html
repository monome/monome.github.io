<p>found while sorting out last month's basement sale, which has ended. approaching the twenty year mark.</p>
<br/><br/>

<p>we'd call it a yardsale but it happened in the basement so let's call it <a href="/basement.html">basement sale</a>.</p>

<p>crow has departed. trent and i agreed that it was time to discontinue as we both have new projects we're deep into and every time crow stock runs out we say we're going to do the successor project. and maybe we actually will, once we emerge from the fog.</p>
<p>but this was also a moment to rediscover what we did, where crow went. it started as a CV extension for norns. but as everything unfolded it went much, much further. the original release video above reminded me.</p>
<p>we look forward to seeing crow's genetics reappear and continue to evolve. thank you for coming on the journey with us.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.audiodamage.com/collections/software/products/ad059-circa">circa</a> by audio damage is a looping-layering plugin akin to mlr (and continued evolutions like <a href="https://cdm.link/mlre-is-an-expanded-version-of-the-classic-monomer-mlr-focused-on-performance/">mlre</a>). it's perhaps the first commercial plugin to directly support monome grids and arc. also, audio damage is one of the few audio companies offering linux support: circa is a good candidate for turning some old laptop into a standalone instrument.</p>
<p>we found a small flock of hiding crows so they're briefly available again.</p>
<br/><br/>

<p>arc running <a href="https://monome.org/docs/iii/library/snows">snows</a> connected directly to an OP-XY, by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jaygilligan_/">jay gilligan</a>.</p>
<p>august 9 at 1pm EDT orders will open for a new batch of norns. we're back to the original encoders, which have a fast action. the knobs sit just a bit higher. they feel great. otherwise everything is the same as before.</p>
<p>at the same time we're making available a lot of b-stock devices. b-stock means something different for various companies, so we <a href="/bstock.html">wrote up the specifics</a> and included some photos. in short: they are near perfect, and they are 10% off.</p>
<p>keep in mind that if you're international and haven't ordered in awhile, we switched over to collecting all import tax and duty ahead of time. on delivery you won't have to deal with any of that complication.</p>
<p>lastly, we're running very low on crow. we will likely not make more. or if we do, it'd be quite some time off. or maybe trent and i will follow through on a new design. but that would be even further off. time flies and crows fly too.</p>

<div style="padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/1099770303?badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; web-share" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" title="arc ribbons"></iframe></div><script src="https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js"></script>
<p>this is <a href="https://monome.org/docs/iii/library/ribbons/">ribbons</a>, a <em>folded euclidean arpeggiator</em>. it sounds good most of the time! a little distraction while trying to wrap up the elusive iii v1.0 (we're close).</p>
<p>arc available again, july 9 1pm EDT. immediate shipping.</p>
<br/><br/>
<p>06/06/25 - unpredictable geopolitics with regard to tariffs have created various levels of delay and price increase so it makes sense not to have surprises when ordering internationally. now all international orders will include duty and taxes to be prepaid. these will be listed as line items, and the package should arrive to you quickly and without added complexity and surprise costs. as before, there's basically no way for us to undervalue packages. as before, if we were to use international retailers these costs would be lumped into the cost passed onto you. but prepaying duty means you lock in a price, whereas the daily policy rollercoaster might leave packages in transit a less certain landing. we'll see how this works out for now and reassess if need be.</p>
<p>mid-summer is intentionally vague as we build more machines and await component shipments, but i think arc may be ready early july and norns in late july.</p>
<p>before then we'll have something to share on the <a href="https://monome.org/docs/iii/">iii</a> front.</p>

<p>here's our friend <a href="https://coolmaritime.org">cool maritime</a> performing with a script we co-designed called <em>erosion</em>.</p>
<p>arc is shipping now. new pre-orders placed now will ship starting late this month.</p>

<p>arc is returning<br />
we said never again and then we<br />
said it would be easy and maybe<br />
we should say less but it is true<br />
what we said first:<br />
next week we begin again.</p>
<br/><br/>
<p>12/18/24 - not the new you're been looking for, but new nonetheless. grid sending usb-midi to a phone making choir ahhhs. what? this grid has a lua script running onboard. a realization, becoming crow-like. ahhh.</p>
<p>just about ready.</p>
<p><img src="/image/news/iii.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<br/><br/>
<p>11/23/24 - we're celebrating the season's first snow storm with candles, waiting for the power to return.</p>
<p>we've added some b-stock units to the site, each in limited supply. it's been said that our b-stock is almost impossible to identify as having imperfections. what that really means is that we've been doing this a really long time and can't unsee some things.</p>
<p>also, if you're near delhi ny and want to pick up anything in person, we love <em>not</em> giving money to credit card companies and will pass along the discount and more. and there are new things to be seen which don't have public announcements yet ready-- but we sometimes pull off a half decent improvised show and tell in person.</p>
<br/><br/>
<p>10/05/24 - cycling74's rnbo now supports monome devices. see the <a href="https://youtu.be/xrWHi84li3I">intro video</a> for a quick overview, and we're assembled a <a href="https://monome.org/docs/grid/studies/rnbo/">grid study for rnbo</a> for a full walkthrough.</p>
<br/><br/>
<p>09/04/24 - norns will be available next tuesday, september 10, at 1pm EST. we'll start shipping same day.</p>
<p>which also means we'll have everything available, all at once. it's a certain kind of miracle.</p>
<br/><br/>
<p>08/30/24 - the apples are falling and the knobs were delayed, but norns are built and waiting. once all the bits arrive we'll announce availability a few days ahead of posting links, then we'll ship same-day.</p>
<p>in the northern hemisphere summer is almost over, but the earlier part of summer brought a <a href="https://llllllll.co/t/a-turntable-for-norns-v2-1-now-with-turntable-drive">turntable for norns</a>, and turntables are also good other seasons as well.</p>
<br/><br/>
<p>07/22/24 - our machine shop is busy milling aluminum and we'll have more norns in late august. maybe sooner, but we'll see.</p>
<p>a delay/looper based on birdsong? yesterday a highly illustrated norns script called <em>messiaen</em> appeared, check it out at <a href="https://llllllll.co/t/messiaen-a-bird-script/68021">llllllll.co</a>.</p>
<br/><br/>
<p>06/18/24 - june 19 we'll have norns available at 1pm EST. early orders will ship immediately, later orders will require about a week as we continue building.</p>
<p>if you're near upstate new york july 12-14: <a href="https://www.woodstockhausen.net">woodstockhausen</a> takes place in a wonderful mountain setting, is very close to <a href="https://luckdragon.space">luck dragon</a> (which is where monome lives), and all of the monome people will be performing. summertimes.</p>
<br/><br/>
<p>06/01/24 - norns coming mid june.</p>
<br/><br/>
<p>04/16/24 - we just shipped another batch of norns pre-orders. we're shipping according to order time and still haven't passed through the initial crush of the first few minutes. the next batch of parts is arriving late next week and we'll get things shipped shortly after that.</p>
<br/><br/>
<p>04/04/24 - many have asked about an upgrade option for existing norns with encoders, to use the infinite potentiometers featured on the new edition. we're testing an idea for this and can share results in a couple weeks.</p>
<p>we've begun shipping norns, according to order times. you'll get a tracking number when yours ships. this first batch is somewhat small as one part was delayed, so we expect to be a week or two behind initial estimates. we'll post an update here soon.</p>
<br/><br/>
<p>03/17/2024 - norns pre-orders are all reserved. shipping will happen throughout april and we'll re-open orders in may for immediate shipment.</p>
<br/><br/>
<p>03/08/24 - norns pre-order set for march 15 1pm EST, shipping early april. check the <a href="old.html">old news</a> for more information about this new edition.</p>
<br/><br/>

<p><a href="https://llllllll.co/t/cc-canvas/66147">cc-canvas</a> is a slewing recallable midi cc bender, made by dan for the grid (zero).</p>
<p>norns components are arriving ahead of next month's edition. it's been something like 18 months since we were able to build a real batch due to shortages. while the upcoming machines will be functionally identical, there are quite a few improvements we made:</p>
<ul>
<li>infinite rotation potentiometers replace the encoders. these have a slower, smoother feel.</li>
<li>thin gorilla glass screen covers replace the plexi. more clear, less scratches, easier to clean.</li>
<li>hard resin knobs and key caps replace molded silicone. because the geometry of the potentiometer is different, but also for less dust.</li>
<li>high quality wifi antenna replaces the cute but weak wifi nub.</li>
</ul>
<p>we're holding the price despite all of this and will confirm the ship date soon. it's been a long time. thank you for waiting.</p>
<br/><br/>
<p>01/10/24 - each crow sings a unique song. trent created a generative sequencer that employs each crow's serial number, captured in this <a href="https://monome.org/docs/crow/first">short video</a> by dan.</p>
<p>it's been nearly a decade and teletype continues to evolve. teletype 5.0 is <a href="https://llllllll.co/t/teletype-5-0-0/65704">here</a>.</p>
<p>friday january 12 1pm EST crow is available again. we'll also have grids in both sizes.</p>
<br/><br/>
<p>12/12/23 - this year the supply chain continued to impact our ability to produce norns, but we did manage to secure parts recently and expect to have a new edition in february. we're engineering a lot of production optimization to offset constantly rising manufacturing costs. one huge benefit of this is a more reliable machine.</p>
<p>we still have grids stocked and ready to ship, though be advised we're entering shipping mayhem season.</p>
<br/><br/>
<p>11/17/23 - december 8 1pm EST we will have grids in both sizes. we will also have norns, both grey and black (so you'll need to choose upon ordering). crow production is scheduled and we expect them to be ready sometime in january.</p>
<br/><br/>
<p>09/25/23 - we'll have grids again in december. a date for crow will become less vague once production gets underway.</p>
<br/><br/>
<p>09/15/23 - grids and crow available today at 1pm EDT. links will go live below, allowing you to place an order. you'll receive a confirmation email upon ordering, and shipping confirmation when they ship out. we have everything built and will start shipping early next week.</p>
<p>we've switched e-mail newsletter providers and are now using a service we very much believe in. if you'd like to continue receiving email news, please <a href="https://buttondown.email/monome">resubscribe</a>.</p>
<br/><br/>
<p>08/25/23 - it's almost september and many of you noticed that we're expecting to have availability in september. we've just set the date: friday, september 15. at 1pm EDT the order links will be live. shipping will begin the following week.</p>
<p>you may have also noticed, below this message next to &quot;old news&quot; is a link to rss. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS">rss (wikipedia)</a> isn't talked about enough these days. you can easily get an rss reader for your phone or computer (or use a web service, but we have a difficult time recommending them). add a new feed: monome.org/rss.xml --- and you will receive updates like this.</p>
<p>this was the decentralized utopia we were promised by computers. maybe we can find it again.</p>
<p>we'll still send out the newsletter, but as email becomes increasingly broken and commodified we'd like to help foster other ways of connecting.</p>
<br/><br/>
<p>06/30/23</p>
<div style="padding-bottom: 56.25%; position: relative;"><iframe style="position: absolute; top: 0px; left: 0px; width: 100%; height: 100%;" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/841239908?autopause=0&byline=0&fun=0&portrait=0&title=0&transparent=0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; fullscreen"  width="100%" height="100%" frameborder="0"></iframe></div>
<p>so we made a new thing<br />
but really an old thing<br />
from over a decade ago<br />
and so there was this impulse that we had to<br />
somehow make the new thing actually new<br />
with a fancy new application or something<br />
but i guess we decided not to do that<br />
this light pattern is an experiment we made a few months ago<br />
with a demoscene-era plasma technique<br />
the important stuff all happens in one line of code<br />
which we wanted to mention simply to spread the concept of<br />
permacomputing and also<br />
despite the grid fundamentally being interactive<br />
sometimes a visual or sound can powerfully stand on its own<br />
like when nine inch nails had this same new thing on stage<br />
just visualizing and hell they are still cooler than us<br />
but really the point is<br />
the grid hasn't meaningfully changed for two decades<br />
still doing nothing yet<br />
containing endless horizons to explore new instrument design<br />
a vehicle for new skills and<br />
perhaps making new friends<br />
but we guess everyone knows that by now<br />
so it's new and it's the same<br />
and that's mostly why there's not really a new killer app<br />
lesser reasons include<br />
us opening an art store and<br />
still tending a farm and finding time to make music<br />
such as this forthcoming softbits you're hearing now<br />
but we are glad to be building these again<br />
and look forward to seeing what comes next</p>
<br/><br/>
<p>06/02/23 - <a href="https://norns.community">norns.community</a> is new. you can read all about it at <a href="https://llllllll.co/t/norns-community-forward">this lines thread</a>.</p>
<p>a small batch of norns will be available june 16 at 1pm EST.</p>
<br/><br/>
<p>05/12/23 - grids came together faster than expected. we'll have a small batch available next friday, may 19, at 1pm EST. crow is now scheduled for late june. we're expecting to also have a small batch of norns in mid june.</p>
<br/><br/>
<p>04/20/23 - more grids expected late may, crow early june</p>
<br/><br/>
<p>03/10/23 - norns and crow are sold out. we'll have new batches of crow and grids later this spring.</p>
<br/><br/>
<p>03/07/23 - crow returns this on friday 1pm EST. note that the price has increased due to modern times. we'll also have a small number of b-stock norns. shipping will begin next week.</p>
<br/><br/>
<p>02/10/23 - we'll have a small batch of grids available next week, on the 17th at 1pm EST. the following day we'll have discounted b-stock grids available. shipping will happen a week or so after.</p>
<br/><br/>
<p>02/01/23 - crow is returning. some of the long-time part shortages have eased and we've started receiving components. we're working on some software improvements in anticipation of shipping a new batch. dates will be announced soon.</p>
<br/><br/>
<p>01/01/23 - <a href="shipping.html">shipping updates</a> now have a dedicated page.</p>
<br/><br/>
<p>12/01/22 - we're enduring the semiconductor shortage alongside basically all small manufacturers. this is the reason that we do not have known restock dates for many of our devices. we'll update this site as we learn more. i wrote a <a href="https://llllllll.co/t/scarcity-and-precarity-in-small-manufacturing/55896%22">longer essay</a> which may be of further interest.</p>
<p>we've also had to increase pricing to accommodate rising costs of components, contract manufacturing, and transportation. in addition to delays we're also encountering quality issues, which contribute a substantial amount of labor to ensure everything is in working order. we'll adjust pricing as the situation changes.</p>
