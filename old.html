<p>it's almost september and many of you noticed that we're expecting to have availability in september. we've just set the date: friday, september 15. at 1pm EDT the order links will be live. shipping will begin the following week.</p>
<p>you may have also noticed, below this message next to &quot;old news&quot; is a link to rss. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS">rss (wikipedia)</a> isn't talked about enough these days. you can easily get an rss reader for your phone or computer (or use a web service, but we have a difficult time recommending them). add a new feed: monome.org/rss.xml --- and you will receive updates like this.</p>
<p>this was the decentralized utopia we were promised by computers. maybe we can find it again.</p>
<p>we'll still send out the newsletter, but as email becomes increasingly broken and commodified we'd like to help foster other ways of connecting.</p>

<p>so we made a new thing<br />
but really an old thing<br />
from over a decade ago<br />
and so there was this impulse that we had to<br />
somehow make the new thing actually new<br />
with a fancy new application or something<br />
but i guess we decided not to do that<br />
this light pattern is an experiment we made a few months ago<br />
with a demoscene-era plasma technique<br />
the important stuff all happens in one line of code<br />
which we wanted to mention simply to spread the concept of<br />
permacomputing and also<br />
despite the grid fundamentally being interactive<br />
sometimes a visual or sound can powerfully stand on its own<br />
like when nine inch nails had this same new thing on stage<br />
just visualizing and hell they are still cooler than us<br />
but really the point is<br />
the grid hasn't meaningfully changed for two decades<br />
still doing nothing yet<br />
containing endless horizons to explore new instrument design<br />
a vehicle for new skills and<br />
perhaps making new friends<br />
but we guess everyone knows that by now<br />
so it's new and it's the same<br />
and that's mostly why there's not really a new killer app<br />
lesser reasons include<br />
us opening an art store and<br />
still tending a farm and finding time to make music<br />
such as this forthcoming softbits you're hearing now<br />
but we are glad to be building these again<br />
and look forward to seeing what comes next</p>
<br/><br/>
<p>06/02/23 - <a href="https://norns.community">norns.community</a> is new. you can read all about it at <a href="https://llllllll.co/t/norns-community-forward">this lines thread</a>.</p>
<p>a small batch of norns will be available june 16 at 1pm EST.</p>
<br/><br/>
<p>05/12/23 - grids came together faster than expected. we'll have a small batch available next friday, may 19, at 1pm EST. crow is now scheduled for late june. we're expecting to also have a small batch of norns in mid june.</p>
<br/><br/>
<p>04/20/23 - more grids expected late may, crow early june</p>
<br/><br/>
<p>03/10/23 - norns and crow are sold out. we'll have new batches of crow and grids later this spring.</p>
<br/><br/>
<p>03/07/23 - crow returns this on friday 1pm EST. note that the price has increased due to modern times. we'll also have a small number of b-stock norns. shipping will begin next week.</p>
<br/><br/>
<p>02/10/23 - we'll have a small batch of grids available next week, on the 17th at 1pm EST. the following day we'll have discounted b-stock grids available. shipping will happen a week or so after.</p>
<br/><br/>
<p>02/01/23 - crow is returning. some of the long-time part shortages have eased and we've started receiving components. we're working on some software improvements in anticipation of shipping a new batch. dates will be announced soon.</p>
<br/><br/>
<p>01/01/23 - <a href="shipping.html">shipping updates</a> now have a dedicated page.</p>
<br/><br/>
<p>12/01/22 - we're enduring the semiconductor shortage alongside basically all small manufacturers. this is the reason that we do not have known restock dates for many of our devices. we'll update this site as we learn more. i wrote a <a href="https://llllllll.co/t/scarcity-and-precarity-in-small-manufacturing/55896%22">longer essay</a> which may be of further interest.</p>
<p>we've also had to increase pricing to accommodate rising costs of components, contract manufacturing, and transportation. in addition to delays we're also encountering quality issues, which contribute a substantial amount of labor to ensure everything is in working order. we'll adjust pricing as the situation changes.</p>
